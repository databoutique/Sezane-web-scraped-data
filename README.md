## About the website

[Sezane](https://www.sezane.com) is a revolutionary online fashion brand headquartered in Paris, France. The entrepreneur Morgane Sezalory founded the brand in 2013 with the goal of offering a new kind of fashion experience; one rooted in quality craftsmanship, sustainable production, and fair pricing. Unlike most fashion brands, Sezane releases seasonal collections and promotes long-lasting fashion. This distinctive approach has earned it a loyal following, making the brand a notable player in the global fashion industry. Despite its notable success, Sezane is not a publicly-listed company; hence, it does not have a stock market symbol, IPO date, or market cap at IPO. To-date, there is no dedicated Wikipedia or Bloomberg page for Sezane.

Sezane faces stiff competition from established and emerging online fashion brands. Brands like [Madewell](https://www.madewell.com/) and [Everlane](https://www.everlane.com) bring comparable business models to the table, focusing on quality, sustainability, and direct-to-consumer selling. Like Sezane, they offer trendy, ethically sourced, and reasonably priced products. Madewell, known for their premium jeans, is a subsidiary of [J.Crew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.Crew), while Everlane is an independent brand that is a vocal proponent of "radical transparency". The business models of these competitors closely mimic that of Sezane, and their impact is felt in the ever-competitive online fashion marketplace. Neither Madewell nor Everlane have dedicated Bloomberg pages, although information on both can be found within the websites of their parent companies.

Companies can derive significant value by using web scraped data from the Sezane website. For instance, tracking price fluctuations and discounts can offer invaluable insights into Sezanes pricing strategies, enabling competitors to better structure their pricing for competitive advantage. Aside from pricing data, trends in product popularity could be gleaned from web scraping user reviews and ratings. This could help businesses to stay ahead of fashion trends and optimise their product offerings. Furthermore, a comprehensive data-driven analysis could help to inform effective marketing and sales strategies, by identifying the brands bestselling products, common customer complaints, and key selling points. Scorecards and sentiment-analysis models could be developed to provide objective metrics for tracking and evaluating Sezanes business performance regularly.
